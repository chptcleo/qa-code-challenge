```bash
# Set environment variable (optional, defaults to 'qa')
export ENV=qa  # or dev, uat, prod
```

## üèÉ Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests with visible browser
npm run test:headed

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:e2e        # End-to-end tests
npm run test:interface  # Interface tests

# Run tests by tags
npm run test:smoke      # Smoke tests only
npm run test:regression # Regression tests only
```

### Advanced Test Execution

```bash
# Run tests in specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/test-para-bank-e2e.spec.ts

# Run tests with custom grep pattern
npx playwright test --grep="registration"

# Debug mode (step-by-step execution)
npx playwright test --debug
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Configuration

Environment-specific settings are stored in `src/config/`:

```json
{
  "baseURL": "https://parabank.parasoft.com"
}
```

## üìä Reporting

### HTML Reports

After test execution, view detailed reports:

```bash
# Open latest report
npm run test:report
```

### Report Features

- **Test Results**: Pass/fail status with details
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of failures
- **Videos**: Test execution recordings
- **Traces**: Step-by-step debugging information
- **Performance Metrics**: Test execution timings

### Artifacts

- **Reports**: `playwright-report/`
- **Screenshots**: `test-results/`
- **Videos**: `test-results/`
- **Traces**: `test-results/`
